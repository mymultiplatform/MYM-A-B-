DYNAMIC WEIGTHS

- Is dynamic because the "stop loss & take profit" is not predetermined.

- Is dynamic because the number of executions is only 20 per SYMBOL. 

- Is dynamic because the the "Hold and Scalp" methods are baced on the RL and not predetermined.

- Is dynamic becasue the "Sell and Buy" options are based on the RL.

- Is dynamic becasue the Set buy limit and Set sell limit are based on the RL.

- Is dynamic becasue the "Lot Size" is based on the RL.

- Is dynamic becasue the "Balance" affects the RL weight.



PUNISH AND REWARD HERARCHY



Punish: 

- Punish if the trades hits Stop loss. 20% important

- Punish if the overall Balance gets reduced. 35% important 


Reward:

- Reward if the trade hits take profit. 21% important

- Reward if the trade makes the Balance grow. 36% important

- Reward ( the more the profit the more the reward ). 37% importnat
