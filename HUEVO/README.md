**FINAL PUZZLE TO COMPLE THE FIRST EXECUTABLE EVOLUTIONARY MODEL**







 The prediction error of the forward model can serve as an intrinsic reward. If the agent is in a




You could approximate entropy-based exploration by maintaining a softmax over Q-values when selecting actions. Instead of argmax(Q), sample actions from a distribution π(a|s) = softmax(Q(s)/temperature)



Consider using an algorithm like PPO or A2C instead of pure DQN. These methods naturally produce a policy distribution over actions. You can then add an entropy bonus term:
Loss = Policy Loss + Value Loss - α * Entropy,

Training Loop Adjustments: In each training step:

    The agent takes an action in the environment, obtains (s, a, r_ext, s').
    Compute φ(s) and φ(s') using the embedding.
    Compute forward prediction error = MSE(predicted_φ(s'), actual_φ(s')) = intrinsic_reward_component.
    Total reward = r_ext + λ * intrinsic_reward_component.
    Store (s, a, total_reward, s') in replay buffer.
    Train forward/inverse dynamics models using (s, a, s').
    Train the RL model (DQN/PPO) using the total reward.


 Curiosity-Driven Exploration
Curiosity aims to reward the agent for visiting novel or unpredictable states. The idea: The agent gets an intrinsic reward when it encounters states it doesn't understand well or can’t predict accurately.

    Forward and Inverse Dynamics Models:
    One common approach (as in the "curiosity-driven exploration" paper by Pathak et al.) is to train two auxiliary models:
        Inverse Dynamics Model: Predicts the action taken given consecutive states (s, s').
        Forward Dynamics Model: Predicts the next state’s embedding given (s, a).
